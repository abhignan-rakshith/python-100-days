Day 6 was all about python funtions and while loops. 

Also learnt when to use what?
for - when you want to do something specific number of times/do something with the itereated element.
while- do something until a condition is false. (Danger: Infinite Loops)

All of these concepts was learnt in https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html, its a GUI base robot moving game using python code.

All the necessary files are attached in the folder.
